<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
My Name is Nicholas Dean. I am a 31-year-old Process Engineering Technician for Sensata Technologies and this is my first semester at BCC, I am on the CIS Programing track. I have an Electronics Engineering AS degree from NEIT. BCC was a logical choice for me as I work on the same campus as the Attleboro site and the class are offered completely online. Recently I have developed an interest in programming for android devices. projects and completed tutorials can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Ndean85">GitHub</a>. The goal for after I complete my degree is to become a remote Android developer.

<br>
I am a Kinesthetic Learner. Knowing the strengths and weakness of this has helped me overcome a lot of scholastic and professional obstacles. I use periodic in office stretching and walks to help maintain focus and cement information. Other tips for Kinesthetic Learners can be found <a href="https://www.brightoncollege.edu/study-tips-for-the-kinesthetic-learner/">here</a>. The largest hurdle I face in life is my chronic procrastination. I attempt to battle this with several time management techniques. I use small goals broken down by day and by two-hour blocks. keeping my calendar updated and synched is absolutely key.
